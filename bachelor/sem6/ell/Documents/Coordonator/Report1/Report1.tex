\section{Plan of Activity}
First and foremost, before understanding the state-of-the-arts, I consider it valuable to learn the way medicine has approached
the Alzheimer's Disease: how the images are obtained and how the disease diferentiates itself from others which revolve around
brain scans.

Secondly, a thorough study of the state-of-the-arts is necessary in order to point out the way Alzheimer's Disease Prediction
has evolved in time, outline strengths and weaknesses, as well as where there could be room for improvements.

Another important step is making sure I can access datasets and compare my approach with the ones that apply on the ones I
have permission to use, since this topic implies utilizing human brain images of patients with Alzheimer's Disease.

At this point, I will have acquired enough information and reference papers to begin both writing the thesis (begin the
Abstract and finalize the Introduction, Related Work and Dataset sections.) and implementing the technical part.

Upon succeeding with implementing the models, I will begin the evaluation and experimenting part and expect failure in
the beginning and with each iteration bring slight improvements of past architectures until satisfied with the results.

Finally, after different experiments, either an improvement or display of previously not tested combinations of
architectures will result which will be presented in the later sections of the paper.

In light of the above, I hope to have achieved valuable knowledge in the intertwined domains of medicine and artificial intelligence,
while also bringing useful information to the chosen topic.

\section{Motivation}
The subjects that peaked my interest the most have been the ones surrounding Artificial Intelligence,
some aspects more than other, for example models, networks of any type (varying from Bayesian to lately Deep Neural ones).

However, I have yet to use the information in a personal interest.
Here one of my all-time biggest curiosity presents itself: the human nervous system.

Thus, my motviation comes from the will to apply techniques learned from Artificial Intelligence in the domain of medicine,
due to my long time interest in it and also to study and understand the way our nervous system functions.
