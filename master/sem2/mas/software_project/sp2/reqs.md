The second module (SP2) of the software project is optional and must demonstrate the use of multiple agents for a specific task (at your choice). 

For example:
- Multiple robotic agents (vacuum cleaners) whose common goal is to clean a room.
- A DAI problem (e.g., distributed path-finding) solved using a distributed AI algorithm and agent-based modeling.

The agent-based system or DAI technique should be completely designed and implemented WITHOUT USING AN EXISTING AGENT DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT. 

A design proposal for a single agent-based system is available at Files/ClassMaterials/SingleAgentDesignProposal.

This design may be extended, or an own MAS design may be proposed by considering the following:
- multiple agents
- the number of agents will be configurable;
- concurrent/parallel execution of agents.
- use of PAGES in the design;
- use a communication model between agents: blackboard or message passing (at your choice);
- for the concrete simulation, a strategy for the agents will be implemented.
