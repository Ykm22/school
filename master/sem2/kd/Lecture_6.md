Knowledge DiscoveryLecture8: TriadicFCA

---

Triadic FCA (3FCA)•Target:triadic data setseither having a natural 3D structure or mapped on 3D in order to find relevant knowledge structures.•Mine after relevant knowledge•Cluster relevant information into triconcepts•Represent triconceptsin a form which is suitable for decision making•Analysethe structure of the triconceptsset in order to find more relevant knowledge structures.

---

Trilatticeexample (4)


---

Disadvantages of the trilatticerepresentation•no automated tool to generate it•difficult to read and to navigate in•the underlying structure of the triconceptscannot be read from the trilattice

---

Proposed solution•A local navigation paradigm in the tricontexts:•one can get from a triconceptto another if it is reachable•once chosen a triconceptyou can see all possible next steps

---

Derived contexts

Exercise assignementLet K=(K1, K2, K3, Y) be a triadic context, where K1 = {1,2,3,4}, K2 = {a,b,c,d}, K3 = {α, β, γ}, and Y={(1,a,β), (1,a,γ), (1,b,α), (1,b,β), (1,c,α), (1,c,β), (2,b,α), (2,b,β), (2,a,β),(2,a,γ),(3,a,β),(3,a,γ),(3,d,α),(4,d,β),(4,a,β),(4,a,γ),(4,b,α), (4,b,β) 1.Give all three slice representations of K.2. Compute three different triconceptsof K.3. For a triconcept(A1, A2, A3) compute the projections KijAk.

Reachability for triconcepts


---

Obtaining the clusters of triconceptsusing a graph•Consider a directed graph with triconceptsas nodes and with directed edges between the triconceptsfor which the reachability relation holds•The strongly connected components of the graph represent the clusters of triconcepts.

---

More than two clusters


---

Reachability in composed tricontexts


---

Size of the tricontextvs. Number of reachability clusters


---

The number of minimal clusters is notbounded by the dimension of the context


---



---

Exercise assignment•Use FCA TOOLS BUNDLE and the local navigation feature for triadic data sets.

---

The context of reachable triconcepts


---

Structure of the clusters


---

OPEN QUESTIONS•What is the depth of the graph of triconcepts?•What is the maximal number of clusters that a tricontextcan have in relation with its dimensions? Current upper bound is the number of triconcepts, which is exponential.•What is the number of minimal clusters that a tricontextcan have in relation with its dimensions?•If we use the reachability relation as a navigation paradigma, which is a suitable starting point? Obviously the starting point should be in a minimal cluster, but which is the right minimal cluster?

Clarified contexts


---

Advantages of reduction•context reduction has no effect on the conceptual structure•reducible objects and attributescan be written as combinations of other objects and attributes•we can reduce the data quantity without losing information

---

Reduced dyadic context
