Similar to the hostel example from the course, find a real life triadic data set. 

Using FCA Tools Bundle, start with computing the triconcepts and then start the local navigation procedure (as explained in the course). 

The aim of this assignment is to familiarize you with triadic data sets, as well as to understand how local navigation works. 

How many clusters can you find in your reachability graph?
