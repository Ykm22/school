# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. Consider a data set of your choice: e.g. from Kaggle or from any
other source (e.g. job or your master thesis).

2. If necessary, apply some AI, KD  and Data Mining algorithms in
order to extract a first layer of knowledge. Describe the results you
have obtained and the knowledge you have extracted.

3. Use either the result of this analysis or any other many-valued
context to build a ToscanaJ system. Describe in detail the scales you
have built and the amount of knowledge you were able to extract
here from. Be inventive and creative in the scale building, usually the
knowledge gems are there, but you need to dig after them. For
ToscanaJ you will need an older version of Java to make it work. (3p)

4. Choose a set of attributes from any source you are comfortable
with (master thesis, job, computer science, etc.) Perform attribute
exploration on this set of attributes and collect the relevant
knowledge from experts in that field. Explain your results and what
you have learned from here.  (1p)

5. Choose a triadic data set and perform knowledge discovery as
discussed at the course. (2p)

6. Temporal Concept Analysis can be used in order to investigate
temporal evolution of conceptual knowledge. Perform a TCA analysis
on a suitable data set and discuss life tracks and other relevant
items. (2p)

7. There are various significant applications of FCA on real life data
and projects. Write a report about one selected application. This
project will be your final mark, so please solve it carefully. You need
to provide a detailed report with your results.  (1p
