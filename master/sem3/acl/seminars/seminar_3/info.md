Seminar 3: Experiment with a corpus!

Get a corpus for English (around 50.000 words). Obtain the representation corresponding to Zipf law. Get a corpus for another language and obtain the same kind of representation. Look at the differences. Compare it with the results obtained by using another corpus. Look at the differences.

Interesting values to extract:

- token count, type count
- graphic representation for top 200 most frequent words (Zipf)
- top 7 most frequent words
- percent of the tokens in the corpus covered by the most frequent 7 words
- percent of words in the corpus covered by words that appear once
  - as types
  - as tokens
