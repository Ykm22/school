SOFTWARE PROJECT

purpose: demonstrate the use of conventional ML techniques on 2 learning tasks


REQUIREMENTS:
- labeled tabular dataset, predefined/handcrafted features
- one dataset - two tasks
  - supervised classification and/or supervised regression
  - supervised classification/regression and or unsupervised var
  - supervised classification/regression vs reinforcement learning
- from scratch
  - model (hyperparameters, optimization)
  - performance eval (cross-validation, eval metrics)
  - existing libraries allowed for data visualisation and numerical computations (numpy)
- implementation using ML software
  - pytorch
- each task should have different classes of learning methods for models (network-based, tree-based, instance-learning-based, etc)

PROJECT COMPONENTS:
- each required document as .pdf, from LaTeX
  - template in /ClassMaterials/LaTeX template (lab assignment)
- sections/subsections for increased readability

1) learning tasks definition
- deadline lab 3 (week 5)
- 10% of the grade
- problem definition, what should be solved
- problem specification, input, preconditions, output and postconditions
- learning tasks specification- TASK, PERFORMANCE, EXPERIENCE (lecture?)
