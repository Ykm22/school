abstract = {Objectives
Bayesian networks (BNs) are rapidly becoming a leading technology in applied Artificial Intelligence, with many applications in medicine. Both automated learning of BNs and expert elicitation have been used to build these networks, but the potentially more useful combination of these two methods remains underexplored. In this paper we examine a number of approaches to their combination when learning structure and present new techniques for assessing their results.
Methods and materials
Using public-domain medical data, we run an automated causal discovery system, CaMML, which allows the incorporation of multiple kinds of prior expert knowledge into its search, to test and compare unbiased discovery with discovery biased with different kinds of expert opinion. We use adjacency matrices enhanced with numerical and colour labels to assist with the interpretation of the results. We present an algorithm for generating a single BN from a set of learned BNs that incorporates user preferences regarding complexity vs completeness. These techniques are presented as part of the first detailed workflow for hybrid structure learning within the broader knowledge engineering process.
Results
The detailed knowledge engineering workflow is shown to be useful for structuring a complex iterative BN development process. The adjacency matrices make it clear that for our medical case study using the IOWA dataset, the simplest kind of prior information (partially sorting variables into tiers) was more effective in aiding model discovery than either using no prior information or using more sophisticated and detailed expert priors. The method for generating a single BN captures relationships that would be overlooked by other approaches in the literature.
Conclusion
Hybrid causal learning of BNs is an important emerging technology. We present methods for incorporating it into the knowledge engineering process, including visualisation and analysis of the learned networks.}

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) have received increasing research attention that is not matched by adoption in practice and yet have potential to significantly benefit healthcare. Hitherto, research works have not investigated the types of medical conditions being modelled with BNs, nor whether there are any differences in how and why they are applied to different conditions. This research seeks to identify and quantify the range of medical conditions for which healthcare-related BN models have been proposed, and the differences in approach between the most common medical conditions to which they have been applied. We found that almost two-thirds of all healthcare BNs are focused on four conditions: cardiac, cancer, psychological and lung disorders. We believe there is a lack of understanding regarding how BNs work and what they are capable of, and that it is only with greater understanding and promotion that we may ever realise the full potential of BNs to effect positive change in daily healthcare practice.}

abstract = {A pneumonia of unknown causes, which was detected in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, was declared as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Thousands of people have lost their lives to this disease. Its negative effects on public health are ongoing. In this study, an intelligence computer-aided model that can automatically detect positive COVID-19 cases is proposed to support daily clinical applications. The proposed model is based on the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and can automatically reveal discriminative features on chest X-ray images through its convolution with rich filter families, abstraction, and weight-sharing characteristics. Contrary to the generally used transfer learning approach, the proposed deep CNN model was trained from scratch. Instead of the pre-trained CNNs, a novel serial network consisting of five convolution layers was designed. This CNN model was utilized as a deep feature extractor. The extracted deep discriminative features were used to feed the machine learning algorithms, which were k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The experiments were conducted on a public COVID-19 radiology database. The database was divided into two parts as training and test sets with 70% and 30% rates, respectively. As a result, the most efficient results were ensured by the SVM classifier with an accuracy of 98.97%, a sensitivity of 89.39%, a specificity of 99.75%, and an F-score of 96.72%. Consequently, a cheap, fast, and reliable intelligence tool has been provided for COVID-19 infection detection. The developed model can be used to assist field specialists, physicians, and radiologists in the decision-making process. Thanks to the proposed tool, the misdiagnosis rates can be reduced, and the proposed model can be used as a retrospective evaluation tool to validate positive COVID-19 infection cases.}

  abstract = {This article delves into the interface between the art of medical diagnosis and the mathematical foundations of probability, the Bayes theorem. In a healthcare ecosystem witnessing an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation, understanding the convergence becomes crucial for physicians. Contrary to viewing AI as a mysterious "black box," we demonstrate how every diagnostic decision by a medical practitioner is, in essence, Bayesian reasoning in action. The Bayes theorem is a mathematical translation of systematically updating our belief: it quantifies how an additional piece of information updates our prior belief in something. Using a clinical scenario of Kartagener syndrome, we showcase the parallels between a physician's evolving diagnostic thought process and the mathematical updating of prior beliefs with new evidence. By reimagining medical diagnosis through the lens of Bayes, this paper aims to demystify AI, accentuating its potential role as an enhancer of clinical acumen rather than a replacement. The ultimate vision presented is one of harmony, where AI serves as a symbiotic partner to physicians, with the shared goal of holistic patient care.},
