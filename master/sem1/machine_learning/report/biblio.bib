  abstract = {Breast cancer is becoming a leading cause of death among women in the whole world, meanwhile, it is confirmed that the early detection and accurate diagnosis of this disease can ensure a long survival of the patients. Expert systems and machine learning techniques are gaining popularity in this field because of the effective classification and high diagnostic capability. In this paper, a rough set (RS) based supporting vector machine classifier (RS_SVM) is proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. In the proposed method (RS_SVM), RS reduction algorithm is employed as a feature selection tool to remove the redundant features and further improve the diagnostic accuracy by SVM. The effectiveness of the RS_SVM is examined on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) using classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed RS_SVM can not only achieve very high classification accuracy but also detect a combination of five informative features, which can give an important clue to the physicians for breast diagnosis.}

  abstract = {In this paper, a decision support system that classifies the Doppler signals of the heart valve to two classes (normal and abnormal) is presented to support the cardiologist. The paper uses our previous paper where ANN is used as a classifier, as feature extractor from measured Doppler signal. To make this, it uses wavelet transforms and short time Fourier transform methods. Before it classifies these features, it applies Wavelet entropy to them. In this paper, our aim is to develop our previous work by using least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier instead of ANN. We use LS-SVM and backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) to classify the extracted features. In addition, we use receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves to compare sensitivities and specificities of these classifiers and compute the area under the curves. Finally, we evaluate two classifiers in all aspects.}

  abstract = {In this research, a hybrid model is developed by integrating a case-based data clustering method and a fuzzy decision tree for medical data classification. Two datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, i.e., liver disorders dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis), are employed for benchmark test. Initially a case-based clustering method is applied to preprocess the dataset thus a more homogeneous data within each cluster will be attainted. A fuzzy decision tree is then applied to the data in each cluster and genetic algorithms (GAs) are further applied to construct a decision-making system based on the selected features and diseases identified. Finally, a set of fuzzy decision rules is generated for each cluster. As a result, the FDT model can accurately react to the test data by the inductions derived from the case-based fuzzy decision tree. The average forecasting accuracy for breast cancer of CBFDT model is 98.4% and for liver disorders is 81.6%. The accuracy of the hybrid model is the highest among those models compared. The hybrid model can produce accurate but also comprehensible decision rules that could potentially help medical doctors to extract effective conclusions in medical diagnosis.}
