  abstract = {This paper applies the methods of multi-dimensional mathematical demography to project national populations based on alternative assumptions on future, fertility, mortality, migration and educational transitions that correspond to the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) storylines. In doing so it goes a significant step beyond past population scenarios in the IPCC context which considered only total population size. By differentiating the human population not only by age and sex—as is conventionally done in demographic projections—but also by different levels of educational attainment the most fundamental aspects of human development and social change are being explicitly addressed through modeling the changing composition of populations by these three important individual characteristics. The scenarios have been defined in a collaborative effort of the international Integrated Assessment Modeling community with the medium scenario following that of a major new effort by the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA, OEAW, WU) involving over 550 experts from around the world. As a result, in terms of total world population size the trajectories resulting from the five SSPs stay very close to each other until around 2030 and by the middle of the century already a visible differentiation appears with the range between the highest (SSP3) and the lowest (SSP1) trajectories spanning 1.5 billion. The range opens up much more with the SSP3 reaching 12.6 billion in 2100 and SSP1 falling to 6.9 billion which is lower than today's world population.}

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTION: It is challenging at baseline to predict when and which individuals who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will ultimately progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. METHODS: A deep learning method is developed and validated based on magnetic resonance imaging scans of 2146 subjects (803 for training and 1343 for validation) to predict MCI subjects' progression to AD dementia in a time-to-event analysis setting. RESULTS: The deep-learning time-to-event model predicted individual subjects' progression to AD dementia with a concordance index of 0.762 on 439 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 6 to 78 months (quartiles: [24, 42, 54]) and a concordance index of 0.781 on 40 Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Aging testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 18 to 54 months (quartiles: [18, 36, 54]). The predicted progression risk also clustered individual subjects into subgroups with significant differences in their progression time to AD dementia (P < .0002). Improved performance for predicting progression to AD dementia (concordance index = 0.864) was obtained when the deep learning-based progression risk was combined with baseline clinical measures. DISCUSSION: Our method provides a cost effective and accurate means for prognosis and potentially to facilitate enrollment in clinical trials with individuals likely to progress within a specific temporal period.

  abstract = {Early identification of individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is important for developing disease-modifying therapies. In this study, given multimodal AD markers and clinical diagnosis of an individual from one or more timepoints, we seek to predict the clinical diagnosis, cognition and ventricular volume of the individual for every month (indefinitely) into the future. We proposed and applied a minimal recurrent neural network (minimalRNN) model to data from The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) challenge, comprising longitudinal data of 1677 participants (Marinescu et al., 2018) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We compared the performance of the minimalRNN model and four baseline algorithms up to 6 years into the future. Most previous work on predicting AD progression ignore the issue of missing data, which is a prevalent issue in longitudinal data. Here, we explored three different strategies to handle missing data. Two of the strategies treated the missing data as a “preprocessing” issue, by imputing the missing data using the previous timepoint (“forward filling”) or linear interpolation (“linear filling). The third strategy utilized the minimalRNN model itself to fill in the missing data both during training and testing (“model filling”). Our analyses suggest that the minimalRNN with “model filling” compared favorably with baseline algorithms, including support vector machine/regression, linear state space (LSS) model, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Importantly, although the training procedure utilized longitudinal data, we found that the trained minimalRNN model exhibited similar performance, when using only 1 input timepoint or 4 input timepoints, suggesting that our approach might work well with just cross-sectional data. An earlier version of our approach was ranked 5th (out of 53 entries) in the TADPOLE challenge in 2019. The current approach is ranked 2nd out of 63 entries as of June 3rd, 2020.}

  abstract  = {The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is connected to the rest of the brain through two main networks: the anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM) systems. Given the crucial role of the MTL and networks in the physiopathology of Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD), the present study aimed at (1) investigating whether MTL atrophy propagates specifically within the AT and PM networks, and (2) evaluating the vulnerability of these networks to AD proteinopathies. To do that, we used neuroimaging data acquired in human male and female in three distinct cohorts: (1) resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from the aging brain cohort (ABC) to define the AT and PM networks (n = 68); (2) longitudinal structural MRI from Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI)GO/2 to highlight structural covariance patterns (n = 349); and (3) positron emission tomography (PET) data from ADNI3 to evaluate the networks{\textquoteright} vulnerability to amyloid and tau (n = 186). Our results suggest that the atrophy of distinct MTL subregions propagates within the AT and PM networks in a dissociable manner. Brodmann area (BA)35 structurally covaried within the AT network while the parahippocampal cortex (PHC) covaried within the PM network. In addition, these networks are differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, with higher tau levels in AT than in PM and higher amyloid levels in PM than in AT. Our results also suggest differences in the relative burden of tau species. The current results provide further support for the notion that two distinct MTL networks display differential alterations in the context of AD. These findings have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The current study provides further support for the notion that two distinct medial temporal lobe (MTL) networks, i.e., anterior-temporal (AT) and the posterior-medial (PM), display differential alterations in the context of Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease (AD). Importantly, neurodegeneration appears to occur within these networks in a dissociable manner marked by their covariance patterns. In addition, the AT and PM networks are also differentially associated with relative tau and amyloid burden, and perhaps differences in the relative burden of tau species [e.g., neurofibriliary tangles (NFTs) vs tau in neuritic plaques]. These findings, in the context of a growing literature consistent with the present results, have important implications for disease spread and the cognitive manifestations of AD in light of the differential cognitive processes ascribed to them.},
