## Run

From WSL </br>
`python3 compile_and_run.py f.txt`

ðŸ”´ Care only works on this f.txt file idk why, some newlines don't get read correctly in others even if u blatantly copy+paste this f.txt file content
ðŸŸ¢ SOLVED: Create .txt file in vim or any wsl text editor for new lines to be considerated
ðŸŸ¡ POTENTIAL SOLVE: Add [\n \n] at new line for Windows text files
